# Interview-Test-Case

This short file involves code that takes in a passed in string and returns the length of the longest word. For example the sentence "I am going on a vacation in March" would return "vacation" as the longest word.

The passed in string gets split into multiple sub strings and then a loop runs through each sub string. A condition statement is then ran to check the length of each sub string and that length is then returned as 
the current longest word. This happens until the entire string ends with the longest word being returned.
